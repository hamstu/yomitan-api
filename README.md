# Yomitan API

## Installation

1. Install Python.

    - Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/

        **On the first page of the installer, make sure to check `Add Python 3.x to PATH`.**

    - Mac: Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run `brew install python3`.

    - Linux: Python is included in almost all distributions.

2. [Download](https://github.com/Kuuuube/yomitan-api/archive/master.zip) and extract this repository to the location you wish to install the files.

3. Run `python install_yomitan_api.py` and follow the prompts. If you do not see any errors, it has successfully installed.

    **If you use Firefox or have built Yomitan from source, please refer to the [How to find your extension ID](#how-to-find-your-extension-id) section below.**

4. Go to the Yomitan settings page on your browser.

5. Enable advanced options by clicking the toggle switch in the bottom left corner.

6. Go to `General` and enable `Enable Yomitan API`. Yomitan will automatically start the API every time you open your browser when this setting is enabled.

7. Click `More...` and click the `Test` button to see if the Yomitan API was installed correctly. You may need to wait a few seconds after enabling the setting for the native messaging component to start up.

## How to find your extension ID

If you are a Firefox user and/or have built Yomitan from source, you need to obtain the extension ID for Yomitan. If you reinstall Yomitan, you may need to get the extension ID again.

- Chrome/Chromium/Edge:

    - Open up your Yomitan settings page. The URL should look something like this:

        ![image](./docs/images/chrome_extension_id.png)

        Note: On Edge, the prefix will be `extension://`. **Make sure to change this to `chrome-extension://`, otherwise it will not work.**

    - Copy everything before `settings.html`. For example: `chrome-extension://mbclianmdhnmblbfecpefmgjhajbioip/`.

        **Make sure to remember the `chrome-extension://` AND the `/` at the end of the ID!!**

    - Rerun the script as seen above and when it displays `Add more extension IDs`, paste the extension ID URL that you got. It should work. Continue with the tutorial.

- Firefox:

    - Go to `about:debugging`, then select `This Firefox` at the sidebar.

    - Scroll until you find Yomitan. It should look like this:

        ![image](./docs/images/firefox_extension_id.png)

    - Copy the `Extension ID`. For example: `{2d13e145-294e-4ead-9bce-b4644b203a00}`.

    - Rerun the script as seen above and when it displays `Add more extension IDs`, paste the extension ID **with the brackets** in the input. It should work. Continue with the tutorial.

## API Paths
